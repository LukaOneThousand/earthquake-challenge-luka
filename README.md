# Earthquake Dashboard Challenge

**Time Limit: 2 hours** | **Goal: Close as many issues as possible**

## The Goal

Build a **real-time earthquake monitoring dashboard** that visualizes seismic activity worldwide.

Your finished product should:

1. Display earthquakes on an interactive map
2. Show earthquake details (magnitude, location, depth, time)
3. Filter earthquakes by magnitude, time range, or region
4. Show statistics (total count, average magnitude, strongest quake)
5. Highlight significant earthquakes and tsunami warnings
6. Auto-refresh with new data
7. Be deployed and accessible via a public URL

**How you build it is entirely up to you.** Choose your own stack, architecture, and approach.

## The Data

USGS provides free, real-time earthquake data via GeoJSON feeds:

| Feed | URL |
|------|-----|
| Last Hour | `https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_hour.geojson` |
| Last 24 Hours | `https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson` |
| Last 7 Days | `https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson` |

See [DATA.md](./DATA.md) for detailed field documentation.

## Rules

1. **Fork this repo** - work on your own copy
2. **Close issues by implementing them** - push your code, then close the issue
3. **Be honest** - only close an issue when the feature actually works
4. **Any stack is allowed** - React, Vue, Svelte, vanilla JS, Python, Node, Go... your choice
5. **You may use AI tools** - but you still need to understand and verify your code

## Scoring

Each closed issue = points (see issue labels):

- `1-point` - Quick wins
- `2-points` - Core features
- `3-points` - Advanced features
- `5-points` - Bonus challenges

## Azure Credentials

You have access to Azure for deployment. Credentials will be provided separately.

Good luck!
